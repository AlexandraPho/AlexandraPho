### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<h1>:wave: Hello World !</h1>
<p align="justify">I'm Alexandra, a young mother and student in web development.

After the birth of my first daughter, I decided to train myself in web development. I first learned on my own then I started looking for a school that would support me in my retraining.
I trained with O'Clock for 6 months.
6 months of intense training.</p>
